Here are some packaging scripts for running the DTN IQFeed iqconnect.exe 
software on a Debian GNU/Linux amd64 system (and probably also relatives 
like Ubuntu).  I hope someone else finds them helpful.

I hereby place these files in the public domain.  They are supplied without 
any kind of waranty.  Maybe someone who knows more about packaging will be
able to fork and improve them or show me how it really should be done... 
(I don't know much about packaging and haven't used the dh_XXX scripts, 
and there are some remaining lintian errors...).

To use this you'll need to talk to DTN about getting an account, and you'll
need to download the IQFeed software for Win32 from DTN yourself (for example
by running 'make fetch').  For more information and for the terms and 
conditions of that software, see www.iqfeed.net.  I have no affiliation with 
DTN (other than being a happy customer!)
